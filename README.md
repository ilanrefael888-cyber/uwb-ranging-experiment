# UWB Ranging Noise Characterization

## Objective
To experimentally characterize distance-dependent noise in a UWB ranging system.

## Experimental Setup
- UWB anchors + mobile tag
- Indoor LOS environment
- Fixed anchor positions
- Distances: 0.5–10 m

## Data
Raw and processed data are available under `data/`.

## Noise Model
The standard deviation of the ranging error is modeled as:
σ(d) = σ₀ + k·d

## Results
See `figures/` for plots and `results/` for summary tables.
